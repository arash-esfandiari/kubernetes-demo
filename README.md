# Kubernetes x Docker Demo - K8Mo

## How to start from this demo?

-   To host on your local machine, you need VM on your local machine to deploy a simple cluster containing only one node. In this case, we are using Docker.

-   Additionally, we need lightweight Kubernetes implementation. Minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.

## Requirements

### Minikube

You can follow [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) documentation to get started.

```bash
$ brew install minikube
```

### Docker
